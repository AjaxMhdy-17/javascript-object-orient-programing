in this article we would explore some of the Object Oriented 
mechanisms supported by JavaScript 

There are certain features or mechanisms which makes a Language
Object-Oriented like

1.Object
2.Classes 
3.Encapsulation
4.Inheritance 

1. Object: Object is a unique entity that contain property and methods 

for Example "Car" is can be said a real life Object , which has 
some characturistics like Color , Type , Model , HorsePower and certain 
action like Drive , Accelarate , TurnRight , TurnLeft , Break , etc.

This characturistic of an Object Called Property and Actions are Called Method
An Object is a Instance of Class , Function , Array , String , almost Every 
element in Javascript is Object .

Note : A METHOD IS JAVASCRIPT IS A PROPERTY OF AN OBJECT , WHOSE TYPE OF VALUE IS A FUNCTION


****Making Object******

#using Object Literal 

const person = {
  
  first_name : 'mhdy' , ///property 
  last_name : 'hasan'  ///property 
  , 
  getFunction : function(){ /// action also a property type function 

    return (`first name : ${this.first_name} and last name : ${this.last_name}`)
  }
  ,
  phone : { ///nested object 
    mobile : '1234' , 
    land_phone : '8765' , 
  }
}

//printing Object
console.log(person)
console.log('\n')
console.log(person.first_name)
console.log(person.getFunction())
console.log(person.phone)
console.log(person.phone.mobile)
console.log(person.phone.land_phone)
