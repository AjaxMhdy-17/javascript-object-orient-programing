Classes : Classes are blueprint of objects , A Class can have many objects ,
because Class is a Templete and Object are instance of class or concrete 
implementation of class .

Note : JavaScript is a prototype based object orient language , which means 
id doesn't have classes rather it define behaviour using constructor functon 
and then reuse it using the prototype
